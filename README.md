This is my first project from the Oden Project's web developer curriculum. <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css">This project</a> had us remake the Google homescreen as accurately as possible using html and css. In this project I did have a bit of a hard time remembering all the information and lessons from the curriculum, but through actually working on the homepage I was able to better retain the information and it became much easier as time went on. Although i was not able to fit the magnifying glass in the search bar, I managed to recreate a good portion of the webpage and had a great time doing so. At this moment I am satisfied with the fruit of my labor and am looking forward to both learning javascript and seeing how much more I will learn on my journey to becoming a web developer.
